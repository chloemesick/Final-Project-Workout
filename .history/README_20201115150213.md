**Workout Log**

*My motivation to create this app was based on my job as a personal trainer, many people who frequent the gym or are navigating the new COVID world of working out at home like to be able to track their workouts. Some like to go by days of the week and have a certain focus for their workout on different days of the week and other people like to track the date they did it to use as an accountability tool. I tried to make the data entry fields versatile so that no matter how you want to track it is customizable to your style. On my page I put up a couple of different formats just to give the user ideas of how they can use the app. I also included a notes sections because this can be super important to a workout if something hurts or you have to modify, you want to be able to log that so that next time you do the workout you can have that information and adjust accordingly.*

The current status of my app is basically done, you can edit, delete and add new workouts, I would like to maybe add some more styling and maybe change the note input box into a bigger text box so you could type longer notes and be able to read the whole thing. You can type as much as you want now, but it types out all on one line and I think it would be more effective in a box. I am pretty proud of how far this one came and that all of the functions work, there is not much besides style that I would change.
