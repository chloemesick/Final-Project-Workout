# Workout Log

## Motivation
_My motivation to create this app was based on my job as a personal trainer, many people who frequent the gym or are navigating the new COVID world of working out at home like to be able to track their workouts. Some like to go by days of the week and have a certain focus for their workout on different days of the week and other people like to track the date they did it to use as an accountability tool. I tried to make the data entry fields versatile so that no matter how you want to track it is customizable to your style. I have included a section for a rating based on the intensity as well as a day of the week drop down menu to remember which day you did this workout on in case you want to repeat it weekly on that day. I also included a notes sections because this can be super important to a workout if something hurts or you have to modify, you want to be able to log that so that next time you do the workout you can have that information and adjust accordingly._


### Current Status 
The current status of my app is basically done, you can edit, delete and add new workouts You can type as much as you want now, but it types out all on one line and I think it would be more effective in a box. I am pretty proud of how far this one came and that all of the functions work, there is not much besides style that I would change.
